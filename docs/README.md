## Fast Image Processing (FIP)
> In-development real-time post-processing library for [Processing](https://processing.org/).

## What is it?
FIP is a library that allows you to add post-processing / image-processing effects to your Processing sketch. 

## Features
- 40 Effects
- Hardware Accelerated
- Lightweight

## Examples

I welcome contributions from the community to make FIP better. If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, or new features to add, feel free to create a [pull request](https://github.com/prontopablo/FIP/pulls).

## Acknowledgments
Many of these shaders were adapted from existing solutions in other programming languages, in these cases, the links to the original shaders can be found at the top of each .glsl file.
